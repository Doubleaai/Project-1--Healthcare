## Project Overview

This project analyses an insurance dataset to understand factors influencing insurance charges. Key variables include age, gender, smoking status, BMI, and region. Using Python, I performed exploratory data analysis through scatter plots, box plots, and bar charts to uncover meaningful trends.

## Data Cleaning

The original dataset required extensive cleaning before analysis. I used Python scripts in the terminal to preprocess the data, handling missing values, categorical encoding, and verifying data consistency. This process was challenging due to package dependencies and environment setup, requiring multiple installations and troubleshooting. Thankfully, AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot were invaluable in guiding me through coding and debugging. The final cleaned data was saved as cleaned_insurance_data.csv, ensuring a reproducible and organised workflow.

## Visualisations Conducted

** Scatter plot: Insurance charges versus age, colour-coded by smoking status.

** Box plot: Distribution of insurance charges by gender.

** Bar chart: Average insurance charges for smokers versus non-smokers.

## Insights and Findings

The analysis reveals that smokers incur higher insurance costs, charges increase with age, and there are noticeable gender differences in costs. These findings help understand key drivers of insurance charges and can inform pricing and risk strategies.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

This project highlights the value of exploratory data analysis in uncovering patterns within insurance data. Future work could involve advanced statistical methods and predictive models to better estimate charges. Further data enrichment and feature engineering may also provide deeper insights.
