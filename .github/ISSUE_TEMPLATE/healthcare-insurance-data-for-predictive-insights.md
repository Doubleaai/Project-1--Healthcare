# Healthcare Insurance Data for Predictive Insights

## About
As a data analyst building a portfolio, I want to explore the factors influencing healthcare insurance charges. Using the Healthcare Insurance dataset from Kaggle ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/healthcare-insurance)), I will analyze and transform the data to uncover key patterns and relationships related to:

- Age
- Gender
- BMI
- Family size
- Smoking habits
- Geographic location

and how these factors collectively contribute to a personâ€™s health insurance costs.

## Goals
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations.
- Clean and preprocess data for accurate analysis.
- Visualize relationships between features and insurance charges.
- Build predictive models to estimate insurance costs based on input variables.
- Generate insights that could inform personalized insurance pricing or health risk assessments.
